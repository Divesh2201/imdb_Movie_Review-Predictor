Kept putting off seeing "Joker" - the fanboy hype and the purported violence, but after seeing the accolades being thrown Joaquin Phoenix's way I gave in and glad I did. All my thoughts are positive thoughts about this movie. His performance is riveting and his cackling laugh and facial expressions are deeply haunting. "Joker" reminded me of another favorite film of mine- "God Bless America." Arthur Fleck could easily be Frank Murdoch's long lost son. Great soundtrack as well. Why so serious indeed!
