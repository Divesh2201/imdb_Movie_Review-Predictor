### A Neural Network Model that predicts weather a Movie Review is a positive or a negative review.
### Language: `Python3`  :snake:
### Library: `Tensorflow 2.0` and `Keras`
### Dataset: Official imdb Reviews
##### Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative), the model trains itself on the train data and predicts the test reviews from the test dataset.

#### We also tested the model on a positive review from the movie "**Joker**" released in Oct 2019 which has not been taken from imdb..and the model worked Successful!
